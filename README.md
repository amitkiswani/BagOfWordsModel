# BagOfWordsModel

Bag of Words model using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and scikit-learn libraries in Python. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code is doing:

# Install NLTK: 
The code first installs the NLTK library using pip.

Define a paragraph: The paragraph variable contains a text string about Elon Musk.

# Tokenization: 
NLTK's sent_tokenize function is used to tokenize the paragraph into sentences.

# Text preprocessing: 
The code iterates through each sentence in the tokenized paragraph and performs the following preprocessing steps:

Remove non-alphabetic characters using regular expressions.
Convert the text to lowercase.
Append the preprocessed text to a corpus list.
Stemming: NLTK's PorterStemmer is used to perform stemming on the words in the corpus. Stemming reduces words to their root or base form.

# Stopword removal: 
NLTK's stopwords corpus is used to remove common English stopwords from the corpus.

# Bag of Words model creation: 
The scikit-learn library's CountVectorizer is used to convert the preprocessed text data into a matrix of token counts, representing the Bag of Words model. The resulting matrix x represents the occurrence of words in the corpus.

Output: The code prints the vocabulary of the Bag of Words model and displays the token counts of the first sentence in the corpus.

Overall, this code snippet demonstrates the process of preprocessing text data and creating a Bag of Words model, which is a common technique used in natural language processing tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis.
